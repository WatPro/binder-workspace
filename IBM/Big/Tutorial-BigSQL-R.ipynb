    "In this tutorial you will learn to work data in Hadoop using SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you specialize in relational database management technology and you have to deal with big data, Apache Hadoop is a perfect container to store and manupulate your data. To query the data stored in Hadoop, we need [__Big SQL__](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/big-sql.html). It allows you to query data stored in Hadoop using industry-standard SQL syntax. Big SQL is designed to provide SQL developers with an easy on-ramp for querying data managed by Hadoop."

    "[IBM Big SQL](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/big-sql.html) provides standards-compliant SQL access to data in Hadoop. Developers familiar with SQL can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work with Hadoop data using SQL in a Jupyter Notebook. The required libraries are pre-installed in your Data Scientist Workbench, so you can establish a connection to a remote Hadoop cluster with Big SQL and then run SQL queries over data in Hadoop.\n",
