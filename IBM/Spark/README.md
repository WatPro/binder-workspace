## Learn to work with remote Spark clusters 

#### Flight delay prediction 

In this tutorial, we use Airline dataset to analyze and predict the flights delys in airports based on past flights. We show how you can use Jupyter Notebook and Local Spark to read, explore, analyze and visualize your results. The dataset that we use in this use-case is the flights related to 2007, containing 7 Million flights. 

#### Improved flight delay prediction with Spark and Big Data

In this tutorial you will learn how to submit Jupyter Python notebooks for execution on a remote Spark cluster. You can use the shared Data Scientist Workbench Spark Sandbox cluster; or the Apache Spark service on IBM Bluemix. Use the power of a cluster to analyze a big dataset including 52 million flights.
